From December 6 to 10, I had the opportunity to attend the [*2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*](https://2023.emnlp.org/) in Singapore. During the conference, I presented posters for two of our works: [Benchmarking the Generation of Fact Checking Explanations](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00601/117871/Benchmarking-the-Generation-of-Fact-Checking) published in TACL journal, and [Countering Misinformation via Emotional Response Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.703/) accepted at EMNLP 2023 main conference.

The latest paper introcues VerMout, the first large-scale and general-domain dataset for the generation of counter-misinformation responses that mimic social media platform style. The dataset is grounded in trustworthy fact-checking articles and comprises ~12 thousand examples.
