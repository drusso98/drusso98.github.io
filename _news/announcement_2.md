On the 7th and 8th of September 2023, I had the privilege of attending [EVALITA 2023](https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/), in Parma, Italy, to present our shared task [PoliticIT](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/8507).

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/EVALITA2023/evalita_presentation.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/EVALITA2023/evalita_group_pic.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

PoliticIT was designed to extract political ideology information from Italian tweets, focusing on two key aspects: self-assigned gender as a demographic trait and the political ideology of the users. To achieve this, we proposed an automatic document classification task on clusters of texts. The challenge attracted participants from around the globe, each bringing innovative approaches to tackle the task.

Iâ€™m really grateful for the opportunity to have been part of EVALITA 2023!
