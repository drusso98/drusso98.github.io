I was accepted to and attended the [Lisbon Machine Learning Summer School (LxMLS)](http://lxmls.it.pt/2024/), held from July 11th to July 17th. Throughout the week, I had the opportunity to participate in high-level lectures and seminars focused on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. In addition to connecting with numerous PhD students from across Europe, I also engaged with researchers and professors, exchanging valuable ideas and insights. Beyond the academic experience, I was captivated by the beauty and vibrant culture of Lisbon, making the week all the more memorable.
