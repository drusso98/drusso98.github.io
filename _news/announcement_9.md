I had an incredible experience discussing insights and future directions for *countering misinformation with LLMs* at the [Language Technology Highlights 2024 (LT@FBK2024)](https://lt-highlights.fbk.eu/home) event, held at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler in Povo, Trento. This one-day event brought together scientists, students, practitioners, and enthusiasts to explore the latest research achievements by various FBK units in language technologies. The event featured a keynote adressed by Barbara Plank from LMU Munich, alongside a series of oral and poster presentations showcasing cutting-edge research. It was a fantastic opportunity to engage with fresh ideas and stimulating conversations in the field of language technology.
