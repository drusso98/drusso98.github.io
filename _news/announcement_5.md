From November 30 to December 2, I had the privilege of attending the [*Ninth Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CliC-it 2023)*](https://clic2023.ilc.cnr.it/) in the marvelous city of Venice. During the conference, I had the pleasure of presenting a poster on our TACL paper, [Benchmarking the Generation of Fact Checking Explanations](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00601/117871/Benchmarking-the-Generation-of-Fact-Checking), as a research coommunication. I also had many insightful conversations and shared some really nice moments with fellow attendees, which made the conference a truly enjoyable and memorable experience!
