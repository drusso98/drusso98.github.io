I am currently a PhD student at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), working with the [Language and Dialogue Technologies (LanD) group](https://land.fbk.eu/) at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/en/) in Trento, Italy. My PhD in Information Engineering and Computer Science is centered on Natural Language Processing and Generation. I hold a master’s degree in Cognitive Science from the [CIMeC center](https://offertaformativa.unitn.it/en/lm/cognitive-science) of the University of Trento and a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/). My primary research goal is to develop advanced neural systems to effectively counter misinformation and fake news online.
